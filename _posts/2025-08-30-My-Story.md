## About Me

Some journeys begin with a destination in mind.  
Mine began with a question:  
**“What can I build that improves lives — something with a lasting impact on society?”**

While studying medicine, I was drawn to more than clinical knowledge. I saw the limits of individual care and felt a deeper pull: to design solutions that scale beyond one patient, one diagnosis, one doctor.

That’s why, early on, I joined **healthcare entrepreneurship and Medical Education Olympiads** — and then founded *Nobel Learn*, a healthcare-focused LMS that trained over **5,000 students** and grew into a 10-person team under my leadership.

This wasn't just a side project. It was the beginning of a belief that became my motto:

> _"I want to create something that impacts society more than just being one doctor ever could."_

I began exploring the intersections of **clinical practice, data, and technology** — and eventually found my way into product management. Over the past **5+ years**, I’ve led product teams across healthcare, fintech, and insurance, bringing together cross-functional collaborators to build tools that are not just functional, but meaningful.

Today, I serve as a **Product Manager at mom.ir**, where I lead the design and strategy for our **AI product team** — working on conversational agents, clinical assistants, and outcome prediction tools tailored to fertility care.

I also drive improvements across our **Health Information System (HIS)**, aligning tech with real-world IVF and surgical workflows. I act as a translator between engineering and clinical teams.
 
I hold an **M.D. from Tehran University of Medical Sciences** and an **MBA in Digital Transformation from Industrial Management Institute** — a mix that helps me bridge the strategic, the scientific, and the deeply human.

## Why I Build

People often ask me:
*“As someone trained in medicine, why move into product management?”*

The answer is simple — but layered.

From the beginning, my passion for medicine and technology grew side by side. I was never just curious about treating patients one by one — I was driven to rethink **how** care is delivered, and how we can make healthcare work better for more people.

When I discovered the world of digital health and clinical system design, I saw clearly where I could create real, scalable impact. Working with tools like HIS, EHR, and CDSS, and studying health information systems & change management, I realized something:
**it’s not just about healing — it’s about redesigning the system to enable healing at scale.**

That’s why I build.
Not just to fix what's broken —
**but to reshape how things are done in healthcare.**
