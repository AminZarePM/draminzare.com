## About Me

Some journeys begin with a destination in mind.  
Mine began with a question:  
**“What can I build that will outlive me?”**

While studying medicine, I was drawn to more than clinical knowledge. I saw the limits of individual care and felt a deeper pull: to design solutions that scale beyond one patient, one diagnosis, one doctor.

That’s why, early on, I joined **healthcare entrepreneurship Olympiads** — and then founded *Nobel Learn*, a healthcare-focused LMS that trained over **5,000 students** and grew into a 10-person team under my leadership.

This wasn't just a side project. It was the beginning of a belief that became my motto:

> _"I want to create something that impacts society more than just being one doctor ever could."_

I began exploring the intersections of **clinical practice, data, and technology** — and eventually found my way into product management. Over the past **5+ years**, I’ve led product teams across healthcare, fintech, and insurance, bringing together cross-functional collaborators to build tools that are not just functional, but meaningful.

Today, I serve as a **Product Manager at mom.ir**, where I lead the design and strategy for our **AI product team** — working on conversational agents, clinical assistants, and outcome prediction tools tailored to fertility care.

I also drive improvements across our **Health Information System (HIS)**, aligning tech with real-world IVF and surgical workflows. I act as a translator between engineering and clinical teams — because innovation only works when everyone speaks the same language.

I hold an **M.D. from Tehran University of Medical Sciences** and an **MBA in Digital Transformation** — a mix that helps me bridge the strategic, the scientific, and the deeply human.

## Why I Build

Because some people fix what’s broken.  
**I build what’s missing.**

My purpose lies in transforming how people **experience healthcare** — with better access, more empathy, and smarter, human-centered systems.

Every product I work on carries that intention.  
Every roadmap reflects that vision.

And if one day I’m no longer here to explain it,  
**I hope the work speaks for itself.**
